"Generate JavaScript code that uses the `require` function to locate the path of a locally installed Node module executable, for example:\n```\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\n// Get the path of the currently running script\nconst scriptPath = __filename;\n\n// Get the directory name of the script\nconst scriptDir = path.dirname(scriptPath);\n\n// Check if the script is being run directly (not via a symlink)\nif (process.argv[0].indexOf(scriptDir) === 0) {\n  // If so, resolve the path of the script relative to the current working directory\n  const resolvedScriptPath = path.resolve(scriptDir, '..');\n\n  // Iterate over all files in the resolved script directory\n  fs.readdirSync(resolvedScriptPath).forEach(file => {\n   // Check if the file is a JavaScript file\n   if (file.endsWith('.js')) {\n     // Require the file and get its exports\n     const moduleExports = require(path.join(resolvedScriptPath, file));\n\n     // Check if the module exports an executable"
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a new copy of a given piece of data, such as an object or array, and modifies it in some way without altering the original data. For example, you could create a function like this:\n```\nfunction mutateData(data) {\n  const newData = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data));\n  // make changes to newData here\n  return newData;\n}\n```\nThis code creates a new copy of the data by parsing a JSON string representation of the data back into an object or array, and then returns the modified version. The original data remains unchanged."
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a nan (not a number) value and returns it.\n\nHere's an example of a package description for nan:\n\n\"nan is a package that provides a simple way to create and work with NaN values in JavaScript. With nan, you can easily create NaN values and perform operations on them, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. nan also includes utility functions for working with NaN values, such as isNaN and isnan.\"\n\nTo generate JavaScript code that accomplishes the same tasks as the nan package, you could use the following code:\n\n`function nan() { return NaN; }`\n\nThis function creates a new NaN value and returns it. You can then use this function to create and work with NaN values in your JavaScript code. For example, you could add the following lines of code to your JavaScript file:\n\n`const nan = require('./nan');`\n`console.log(nan()); // Output: NaN`\n`console.log(nan + 1); // Output: NaN`\n`console.log(nan * 2); // Output: NaN`\n`console.log(nan / 2); // Output:"
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a MiniPass stream, reads all the data from the stream, and collects it into a single chunk.\n\nHere is an example of how this could be done:\n```\nconst minipass = require('minipass');\n\n// Create a MiniPass stream\nconst stream = minipass();\n\n// Read all the data from the stream\nconst data = [];\nstream.on('data', (chunk) => {\n  data.push(chunk);\n});\n\n// Collect the data into a single chunk\nconst finalChunk = Buffer.concat(data);\n\n// End the stream\nstream.end();\n\n// Return the final chunk\nreturn finalChunk;\n```\nThis code creates a MiniPass stream using the `minipass()` function, and then sets up an event listener for the `'data'` event. Whenever data is received from the stream, it is pushed onto an array called `data`. Once the stream is ended, the `finalChunk` variable is set to the concatenation of all the chunks in the `data` array, and the `finalChunk` is returned."

"Generate JavaScript code that finds all dependencies within a JavaScript file using AMD module syntax:\n```\nvar require = window.require;\nvar define = window.define;\n\nfunction findDependencies(file) {\n  var dependencies = [];\n  var moduleName;\n \n  // Get the module name from the file path\n  moduleName = file.substring(0, file.lastIndexOf(\".js\"));\n \n  // Use AMD's require function to load the module\n  require([moduleName], function() {\n   // Check if the module has been defined\n   if (define.amd) {\n     // Get the list of dependencies from the define call\n     dependencies = define.amd.dependencies;\n   }\n  });\n \n  return dependencies;\n}\n```\nThis code uses the `window.require` and `window.define` variables to interact with the AMD module system. It gets the module name from the file path and uses `require()` to load the module. If the module has been defined using `define()`, it extracts the list of dependencies from the `define.amd.dependencies` property and returns them."
"Generate JavaScript code that uses the ECMA-376 spreadsheet format codes to format data, similar to how it is done in this package description:\n\n\"This package provides a simple way to format data using ECMA-376 spreadsheet format codes.

"Generate JavaScript code that translates ECDSA signatures between ASN.1/DER and JOSE-style concatenation using the `crypto` module, like so:\n```\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\n\nfunction translateEcdsaSignature(signature, fromFormat, toFormat) {\n  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');\n  const key = new crypto.ECKey(signature, 'hex', true);\n  const convertedSignature = key.signature importFor('der', hash).export('raw', true);\n  return convertedSignature;\n}\n```\nThis function takes in three parameters: `signature`, which is the ECDSA signature to be translated, `fromFormat`, which specifies whether the input signature is in ASN.1/DER format (true) or JOSE-style concatenation format (false), and `toFormat`, which specifies the desired output format (ASN.1/DER or JOSE-style concatenation). The function returns the translated signature in the specified format."
"Generate JavaScript code that exports a module with a function identical to _.groupBy from Lodash.\n\nHere is some sample code to get you started:\n\n```\nfunction _(arr) {\n  return arr.GROUPBY(function(obj, val, key) {\n   var ret = {};\n   for (var i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {\n     if (!ret[val]){\n       ret[val] = [];\n     }\n     ret[val].push(obj[i]);\n   }\n   return ret;\n  });\n}\n\nmodule.exports = _;\n```\nThis code defines a function `_` that takes an array as input and applies the `GROUPBY` function to it. The `GROUPBY` function takes three arguments: the current element being processed, its index in the array, and the key associated with the current group. It returns an object with the keys generated by the `GROUPBY` function and values of arrays containing all elements that share the same key. Finally, the function exports the `_` function as a module."
"Generate JavaScript code that determines whether a given value is callable, including functions and generator functions, regardless of their `@@toStringTag` in ECMAScript 6.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n```\nfunction isCallable(value) {\n  return typeof value === 'function' || (value instanceof GeneratorFunction && value['@@toStringTag'] === 'generator');\n}\n```\nThis function takes a single argument `value`, which can be any JavaScript value. It first checks if `value` is a function using the `typeof` operator. If it is, the function returns `true`.\n\nIf `value` is not a function, it checks if `value` is an instance of `GeneratorFunction` (a class that implements the `Iterator` interface). If it is, it retrieves the `@@toStringTag` property from the object and checks if it is equal to `'generator'`. If both conditions are true, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`."

These functions take three arguments: `target`, `propertyKey`, and (for the `set` function) `value`. The functions return a new function that will call the original method on the `target` object, either getting or setting the value of the property identified by `propertyKey`. The new function returned by `get` or `set` can then be used as a delegate for the original method, allowing you to control"

"Generate JavaScript code that converts a source-map from/to different formats and allows adding/changing properties:\n\nconst convertSourceMap = (srcMap, format) => {\nlet newSrcMap = {};\nfor (let prop in srcMap) {\nif (format === \"json\") {\nnewSrcMap[prop] = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(srcMap[prop]));\n} else if (format === \"csv\") {\nnewSrcMap[prop] = CSV.parse(CSV.stringify(srcMap[prop]));\n} else {\nthrow new Error(`Unsupported format: ${format}`);\n}\n}\nreturn newSrcMap;\n};"
"Generate JavaScript code that sets a value for a key on an object, similar to lodash's _.set method, but as a standalone function exported as a module:\n```\nexport function set(obj, path, value) {\n  return _.set(obj, path, value);\n}\n```\nThis code exports a function called `set` that takes three arguments: `obj`, `path`, and `value`. It then calls the lodash method `_.set` with those arguments, returning the result. This allows you to use the `set` function like you would use the lodash method, but without having to import the entire lodash library."
"Generate JavaScript code that lexically analyzes CommonJS modules, returning their named exports metadata:\n\nconst lexer = require('@istanbul/lexer');\nconst visitor = {\n  ExportDefaultDeclaration(node) {\n   const name = node.declaration.name;\n   return { type: 'ExportNamed', name };\n  },\n  ExportNamedDeclaration(node) {\n   const name = node.name;\n   return { type: 'ExportNamed', name };\n  }\n};\n\nfunction getExports(module) {\n  const ast = lexer.parse(module);\n  return visitor.visit(ast).filter(exportNode => exportNode.type === 'ExportNamed');\n}\n\nmodule.exports = getExports;"
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a random temporary file or directory path using the `os` and `crypto` modules, for example:\n```\nconst os = require('os');\nconst crypto = require('crypto-js');\n\nconst tempFilePath = `${os.tmpdir()}/${crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(10))}`;\n```\nThis will create a random file path in the system's temporary directory, using the `os.tmpdir()` method to get the path of the temporary directory, and `crypto.getRandomValues()` to generate a random string of characters to use as part of the file name. The resulting path will be a unique, randomly generated file path that can be used for temporary storage."
"Generate JavaScript code that returns true if a filepath exists on the file system and it's directory using `fs` module, we can use the `fs.stat()` method to check if the file exists and `fs.directory()` method to check if the file is a directory.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement this functionality in JavaScript:\n```\nfunction exists(filePath) {\n  return fs.stat(filePath).isFile() && fs.directory(filePath);\n}\n```\nThis function takes a file path as an argument, uses `fs.stat()` to check if the file exists and `fs.directory()` to check if it's a directory, and returns `true` if both conditions are met, otherwise it returns `false`."
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a Typescript assertion library for TypeScript 3.7+ using the `assert` function to validate type constraints and throw errors when violated, including a custom error message.\n\n```\nconst assert = (expression: any, message?: string) => {\n  if (!expression) {\n   throw new Error(message || \"Assertion failed\");\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThis code defines an `assert` function that takes two arguments: `expression` (which is any value) and `message` (an optional string). If `expression` evaluates to falsey (i.e., it's not truthy), then it throws an `Error` object with the message provided in the second argument, or a default message if none was passed."
"Generate JavaScript code that implements a shim for the setImmediate API, allowing for efficient script yielding, using the following code:\n```\n(function() {\n  var originalSetImmediate = window.setImmediate;\n  window.setImmediate = function(fn) {\n   var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\n   setTimeout(function() {\n     fn.apply(this, args);\n   }, 0);\n  };\n})();\n```\nThis code defines a shim for `setImmediate` by overriding the original `setImmediate` function with a new implementation that uses `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 milliseconds to schedule the function call. This allows the browser to continue processing other tasks in the meantime, making the API more efficient."
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a fast and powerful CSV parser for the browser that supports web workers and streaming large files, converting CSV to JSON and JSON to CSV, using the following code:\n```\nconst worker = new Worker('csv-parser-worker.js');\n\nworker.onmessage = event => {\n  if (event.data.type === 'csv-row') {\n   // Handle incoming CSV row data\n  } else if (event.data.type === 'csv-end') {\n   // Handle end of CSV file\n  }\n};\n\nworker.postMessage({ type: 'start', filename: 'example.csv' });\n\n// Streaming large file\nconst reader = new FileReader();\nreader.readAsText(file);\nreader.onload = event => {\n  worker.postMessage({ type: 'csv-chunk', data: event.target.result });\n};\n```"
"Generate JavaScript code that watches globs and executes a function upon change, with intelligent defaults for debouncing and queueing:\n```\nconst watchGlob = require('watch-glob');\n\nwatchGlob('**/*.js', { ignoreInitial: true, interval: 100 }, (file, curr, prev) => {\n  // Your function to execute upon change\n  console.log(`File changed: ${file}`);\n});\n```\nThis code uses the `watch-glob` package to watch for changes in JavaScript files in the current directory and its subdirectories. The `ignoreInitial` option is set to `true` to skip the initial run of the function when the watcher is started. The `interval` option is set to 100 milliseconds to debounce the function execution. When a change is detected, the function will be executed with the current file path and contents as arguments."
"Generate JavaScript code that escapes a string for use in HTML:\n```\nfunction escapeHtml(str) {\n  return str.replace(/[&<>\"']/g, function(match) {\n   switch (match) {\n     case \"&\":\n       return \"&amp;\";\n     case \"<\":\n       return \"&lt;\";\n     case \">\":\n       return \"&gt;\";\n     case '\"':\n       return \"&quot;\";\n     case \"'\":\n       return \"&apos;\";\n     default:\n       return match;\n   }\n  });\n}\n```\nGenerate JavaScript code that unescapes a string from HTML:\n```\nfunction unescapeHtml(str) {\n  return str.replace(/&([a-zA-Z0-9]+);/g, function(match, p1) {\n   switch (p1) {\n     case \"amp\":\n       return \"&\";\n     case \"lt\":\n       return \"<\";\n     case \"gt\":\n       return \">\";\n     case \"quot\":\n       return '\"';\n     case \"apos\":\n"
"Generate JavaScript code that reads and caches the entire contents of a file until it is modified:\n\n```\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst cache = {};\nfs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {\n   if (!err) {\n       cache.data = data;\n       cache.mtime = fs.statSync('file.txt').mtime;\n   }\n});\nfs.watch('file.txt', () => {\n   const currentMtime = fs.statSync('file.txt').mtime;\n   if (currentMtime !== cache.mtime) {\n       cache.data = null;\n       cache.mtime = currentMtime;\n   }\n});\n```\nThis code uses the `fs` module to read the contents of the file and cache it in memory. It also sets up a watcher on the file using the `fs.watch()` method, which will trigger whenever the file is modified. When the watcher triggers, it checks if the modification time of the file has changed and if so, it clears the cached data and updates the modification time in the cache."
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a Webpack plugin which enables Subresource Integrity by adding an integrity attribute to all script tags, like so:\n```\nmodule.exports = function () {\n  return {\n   plugins: [\n     new webpack.plugin.SubResourceIntegrity({\n       integrity: ['sha384-[SHAsalted hash of the file contents]'],\n       append: true\n     })\n   ]\n  };\n};\n```\nThis code creates a new instance of the `webpack.plugin.SubResourceIntegrity` class, passing in an options object with two properties: `integrity` and `append`. The `integrity` property specifies the SHA-384 hash of the file contents, and the `append` property is set to `true` to indicate that the integrity attribute should be added to existing scripts, rather than replacing them.\n\nThe plugin is then returned as part of the configuration object, which can be used to configure Webpack when building your application."

"Generate JavaScript code that returns the description of a Symbol, handling both `Symbol()` and `Symbol('')` cases properly:\n```\nconst getSymbolDescription = (symbol) => {\n  return symbol.toString();\n};\n```\nThis code takes a `symbol` argument and uses the `toString()` method to retrieve its description. If the `symbol` parameter is a `Symbol` object created with the empty string constructor (`Symbol('')`), the `toString()` method will return the empty string; otherwise, it will return the description provided in the constructor."
"Generate JavaScript code that adds a static `extend` method to a class, simplifying inheritance, extending static properties, prototype properties, and descriptors from a `Parent` constructor onto `Child` constructors:\n```\nfunction extend(Child, Parent) {\n  Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);\n  Child.prototype.constructor = Child;\n  for (var key in Parent) {\n   if (Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Parent, key)) {\n     Object.defineProperty(Child, key, Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(Parent, key));\n   }\n  }\n  return Child;\n}\n```"

If the expression is not a MemberExpression, the original expression is returned unchanged."
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a convenience wrapper for ReadableStream, with an API lifted from \"from\" and \"through2\" as follows:\n\nconst readableStreamWrapper = (stream) => {\n const wrappedStream = new ReadableStream({\n  read(size) {\n  return stream.read(size);\n  },\n  cancel() {\n  stream.cancel();\n  }\n });\n return wrappedStream;\n};\n\nThis code creates a function called `readableStreamWrapper` that takes in a `ReadableStream` object as an argument. It then creates a new `ReadableStream` object using the `stream.read()` method and the `stream.cancel()` method. The new `ReadableStream` object is returned by the `readableStreamWrapper` function. This allows you to use the `from` and `through2` APIs with the wrapped stream, just like you would with a regular `ReadableStream`."
"Generate JavaScript code that implements a tiny binary search function with comparators, using the following algorithm:\n\nfunction binarySearch(arr, target, compare) {\nlet low = 0;\nlet high = arr.length - 1;\nwhile (low <= high) {\nconst mid = (low + high) >>> 1;\nif (compare(arr[mid], target) === 0) {\nreturn mid;\n} else if (compare(arr[mid], target) < 0) {\nlow = mid + 1;\n} else {\nhigh = mid - 1;\n}\n}\nreturn -1;\n}\n\nThis function takes an array, a target value, and a comparison function as inputs, and returns the index of the target value in the array if it exists, or -1 if it does not exist. The comparison function should return 0 if the values are equal, negative number if the first argument is less than the second, and positive number if the first argument is greater than the second."
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a robust base64 encoder/decoder that is fully compatible with `atob()` and `btoa()`, written in JavaScript, like so:\n```\nconst base64 = {\n  encode: str => btoa(str),\n  decode: str => atob(str)\n};\n```\nThis code defines an object called `base64` with two methods: `encode` and `decode`. The `encode` method takes a string `str` as input, uses the `btoa()` function to convert it to a base64 encoded string, and returns the result. The `decode` method takes a base64 encoded string `str` as input, uses the `atob()` function to convert it back to a string, and returns the result. This implementation ensures that the encoding and decoding processes are reversible and always produce the original input string, making it fully compatible with the built-in `atob()` and `btoa()` functions."
"Generate JavaScript code that implements a module for calculating Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for Node.js and the browser, using the given package description.\n\nHere is a possible implementation:\n```\nconst crc = {\n  /**\n  * Calculates the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) of a given message.\n  * @param {string} message The message to calculate the CRC for.\n  * @returns {number} The calculated CRC.\n  */\n  calculate: function(message) {\n   // Implement the CRC calculation algorithm here\n   return crc32(message);\n  },\n\n  /**\n  * Returns the CRC-32 polynomial used by the calculator.\n  * @returns {number} The CRC-32 polynomial.\n  */\n  getPolynomial: function() {\n   return 0x104C11;\n  },\n\n  /**\n  * Sets the seed value used by the calculator.\n  * @param {number} seed The new seed value.\n  */\n  setSeed: function(seed) {\n   //"

"Generate JavaScript code that writes a given string, buffer, or stream to a randomly generated temporary file:\n```\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\n(async () => {\n  const tempFilePath = await fs.promises.mkstemp('./temp-');\n  const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(tempFilePath);\n\n  // Write the input string/buffer/stream to the temp file\n  await writeStream.write(input);\n\n  // Close the write stream\n  await writeStream.close();\n\n  console.log(`Wrote input to temporary file ${tempFilePath}`);\n})().catch((err) => {\n  console.error(`Error writing to temporary file: ${err}`);\n});\n```\nThis code uses the `fs` module to create a new temporary file using `mkstemp`, then creates a write stream for the file and writes the input string/buffer/stream to it using the `write()` method. Finally, it closes the write stream and logs a message indicating that the input has been written to the temporary file."

"Generate JavaScript code that creates a tiny, correct, general-purpose, and configurable \"exports\" and \"imports\" resolver without file-system reliance:\n\nconst resolve = (moduleName, exports, imports) => {\n  const module = { exports, imports };\n  return {\n   get exports() {\n     return exports;\n   },\n   get imports() {\n     return imports;\n   },\n   register(name, value) {\n     if (name in exports) {\n       throw new Error(`Attempting to register duplicate export ${name}`);\n     }\n     exports[name] = value;\n   },\n   unregister(name) {\n     delete exports[name];\n   },\n   resolve(name) {\n     return name in exports ? exports[name] : void 0;\n   },\n  };\n};\n\nThis code defines a function `resolve` that takes three arguments: `moduleName`, `exports`, and `imports`. It returns an object with four properties: `exports`, `imports`, `register`, and `unregister`. The `exports` property is an object containing all the exports of"
"Generate JavaScript code that creates an array of numbers from 1 to 10, and then uses a faster alternative to the native filter() method to filter out the even numbers, resulting in an array of odd numbers from 1 to 9.\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n```\nconst numbers = Array(10).fill(0).map((_, index) => index + 1);\nconst filteredNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 !== 0);\nconsole.log(filteredNumbers); // Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n```\nThis code first creates an array of numbers from 1 to 10 using the `Array(10).fill(0).map()` method. Then, it uses the `filter()` method to create a new array containing only the odd numbers. The `filter()` method takes a callback function that tests whether a given element should be included in the new array. In this case, the callback function is `number => number % 2 !== 0`, which returns `true` for odd numbers and `false` for even numbers. Finally, the `console.log()` statement prints the resulting"
"Generate JavaScript code that fills in a range of numbers or letters, optionally passing an increment or `step` to use, or create a regex-compatible range with `options.toRegex`:\n\n```\nfunction fillRange(start, end, step, options) {\n  const range = [];\n  for (let i = start; i <= end; i += step) {\n   range.push(i);\n  }\n  if (options && options.toRegex) {\n   return range.join('');\n  }\n  return range;\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes four arguments: `start`, `end`, `step`, and `options`. The `start` and `end` parameters are the minimum and maximum values of the range, respectively. The `step` parameter is optional and specifies the increment between each value in the range. If `step` is not provided, it defaults to 1.\n\nThe `options` object is also optional and contains various properties that can be used to customize the behavior of the function. One such property is `toRegex`, which, when set to `true`, causes the function to return a regular expression that matches"
"Generate JavaScript code that creates a write stream constructor which supports a flush method that is called before the finish event is emitted:\n\n`function FlushWriteStream(writable, options) {\nlet flushCallback;\nreturn new Writable({\nwrite(chunk, encoding, callback) {\nflushCallback = callback;\n// Perform write operation\ncallback();\n},\nflush(callback) {\nif (flushCallback) {\nflushCallback();\n}\n// Perform flush operation\ncallback();\n},\ndestroy(error, callback) {\nif (error) {\nthrow error;\n}\n// Perform destroy operation\ncallback();\n}});\n}`\n\nThis code defines a `FlushWriteStream` function that takes in a writable stream and an optional options object. It returns a new writable stream that has a `write()` method, a `flush()` method, and a `destroy()` method. The `write()` method performs a write operation and stores the callback function passed to it in the `flushCallback` variable. The `flush()` method is called before the `finish` event is emitted, and it calls the `flushCallback` function if it exists. The `destroy()` method"
