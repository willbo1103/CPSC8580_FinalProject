"Generate JavaScript code that creates an ES2015-compliant shim for Object.is which differentiates between -0 and +0:\n```\nconst objectIs = (a, b) => a === b || a !== a && b !== b;\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe `objectIs` function takes two arguments `a` and `b`. It returns `true` if they are the same value, or `false` otherwise. The function uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality, but also checks if both values are not `NaN` using the `!==` operator. This is necessary because `-0` and `+0` are considered equal when using the `===` operator, but they are not the same value. The `!==` operator will return `true` if either value is `NaN`, so the function will correctly distinguish between `-0` and `+0`."
